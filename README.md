# Star-Wars-RPG
This is a simple Star Wars themed RPG game with four characters. The player beings by choosing their character, then their opponent. The player and the computer's character engage in battle until one reaches 0 HP. If the player defeats the computer's character they choose another opponent character and keep battling until they deafeat all opponents or are defeated themselves. 

The characters posses two more stats in addition to HP: attack and speed. The attack stat is used in the calculation of damage done by an attack; two characters may use the same attack move, but the one with the higher attack stat will do more damage. The speed stat determines whether the player or the computer goes first in the round. 

So far, there are two types of moves: attack and speedmod. Attack moves do damage, while speedmods modify the speed stat. Further, speedmods come in two varieties, those that target the character using them and those that target their opponent. Self-targeting speedmods boost the speed of the user, while opponent-targeting speedmods lower the speed of the opponent. Both attacks and speedmods have a specific accuracy that controls the probablity of the move hitting. Self-targeting moves have an accuracy of 1 (or 100%).

More stats and move types may be added in the future.
